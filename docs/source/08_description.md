# Introduction

## Background

### Introducing ACRO

The ACRO research group (Automation, Computer Vision and Robotics) is part of the Mechanical Engineering Department at KU Leuven and is located in the Technology Center on the Diepenbeek campus.

The main research topics of ACRO lies in the fields of vision and robotics, combining them in an innovative and effective way to offer solutions where previously they were not possible.

They offer support to other companies to integrate these technologies in their applications.

The ACRO team provides official courses in PCL programming, as well as supervises master theses, from the educational program Electromechanics/Automation within the faculty of Engineering Technology, hosted jointly by Ku Leuven and UHasselt.

ACRO focuses on applications oriented to industrial research in the fields of automation and robotics. Current research topics include:

- Vision-based and model-based automation
- Human-robot interaction and collaboration
- Flexible product handling and robotic grippers
- Collision-free trajectory generation and navigation
- Semi-autonomous and autonomous (dis)assembly
- Functional programming for robotics and the cloud

### Introducing Colruyt Group

Colruyt Group is a Belgian multinational family distribution company that rules the Colruyt supermarkets that started in Lembeek, near Halle, Belgium.

Founded in 1925, the group today is known for its discount supermarket chain. Colruyt's headquarters are based in Halle and they operate in the Benelux and France.

The group's main business is its Colruyt discount supermarket stores. They have more than 200 locations in Belgium, it is the largest supermarket chain.

Colruyt Group can actually be divided into the logistics area (stores and warehousing) and the research and development department where they perform research mainly in the field of map building and mobile robotics.

## Problem description

Colruyt Group desires to automate the cleaning processes of its stores, specifically the cleaning of floors.

Nowadays, the process of cleaning the stores is performed manually: employees first clean the floor of dust and objects, and then pass the machines that scrub the floor.

The technology to clean the dust is surpassed with current autonomous vacuum cleaner robots.

Colruyt Group is already looking for a way to automate the scrubbing machines, but the floor is required to be free of any objects before scrubbing.

The purpose of this work is to build a proof of concept of a system that can be mounted on an autonomous mobile platform, to detect and localise garbage on the floor (inside a supermarket), and then to pick up the garbage.

The work done in this project is a first approach and serves as a basis for future work and also demonstrate  that is possible the automation of this process.

## Contributions

The contributions of this thesis lie in studying the state of the technologies necessary for the development of the project, testing different techniques and making decisions based on the results, always with the support of ACRO.

The topics in which this project contributes the most are:

- Automated camera laser scanner calibration
- A technique based on vision to detect dirt on a floor
- Made a test facility and tested the approach in a test environment

## Summary of chapters

This is a brief outline of what went into each chapter. **Chapter 2** explains the literature that have been read and discuss the interesting topics. **Chapter 3** discusses the implementation of the techniques to detect the dirt. **Chapter 4** talks about the camera calibration. Finally **Chapter 5** shows the results and conclusions.
